##MEMORY MANAGEMENT##

All the loading of SDL resources should be made using the
ResourceManager class. It's vital that you manually
unload every loaded resource. A simple way to do so is
by loading resources in the constructor and unloading them
in the destructor.

An example of the above could be:
class Sprite {
	Texture texture;
	string texturePath;
	public Sprite(string file) {
		texturePath = file;
		texture = ResourceManager.LoadTexture(texturePath);
	}
	
	~Sprite() {
		ResourceManager.UnloadTexture(texturePath);
	}
}

By doing so, the ResourceManager will make sure the texture
doesn't cause a memory leak in the future.
